# when running the container, but it presents two problems:
# first, it doesn't work with maestro-ng and many other solutions that don't support
# the -h argument
# second, there's no way to use the container's name, when using -h we need to define
# the container's name so is not an ideal solution because other thinks can break
# when setting the name manually
# We then just rewrite the hosts file
